# Lights


### Positional vs Directional
Light sources can be positional or directional.
* **Positional** - It's position will determine how a scene is lit. A lamp inside a room is a positional light source. Objects far away will receive little light and may be obscured. 
* **Directional** - Will illuminate all objects in a scene, regardless of distance from the source. The sun is an example of a directional light source.
