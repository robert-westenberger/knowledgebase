# What are Mipmaps
Mipmaps are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the previous.

You can visualize mipmaps as a pyramid of images. The base of the pyramid is the full sized image in the original resolution. As you ascend up the pyramid, each level is a progressively lower resolution.
