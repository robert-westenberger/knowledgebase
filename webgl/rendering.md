# WebGL
* WebGL uses immediate-mode rendering, as opposed to a declaritive retained-mode rendering. Retained-mode rendering holds the scene in memory, and the graphics library API can be called to update the scene. Immediate-mode rendering is procedural, requiring the application to update state itself and draw the scene from scratch each time.
