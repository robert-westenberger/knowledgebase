# Training a Digit Classifier
## Pixels: The Foundations of Computer Vision
In a computer, everything is represented as a number. To view the numbers that make up a particular image, we can convert it to a NumPy array or a PyTorch tensor. 

Here is an example using numpy

```
array(<open PIL image>)[4:10,4:10]
```

it outputs

```
array([[  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],
       [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  29],
       [  0,   0,   0,  48, 166, 224],
       [  0,  93, 244, 249, 253, 187],
       [  0, 107, 253, 253, 230,  48],
       [  0,   3,  20,  20,  15,   0]], dtype=uint8)
```

The `4:10` indicatres we requested the rows from index 4 (inclusive) to 10 (not inclusive).
