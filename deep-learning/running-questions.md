1. When and why would you use L1 norm over L2 norm and vice versa?([how-deep-learning-works-under-the-hood](/deep-learning/how-deep-learning-works-under-the-hood) see "Measure the difference from an arbitrary 3 and the ideal 3")

2. In chapter 5 of the book, Pet Breeds, the model gets confused about very close breeds (american pit bull terrier vs staffordshire terrier, chihuahua vs miniature pinscher, etc). Is there any way to manipulate the model such that these differences are ignored?
