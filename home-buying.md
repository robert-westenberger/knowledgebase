# Realtors
## Interview Questions
"What is your experience in the real estate industry and specifically in this local market?"

"How many clients are you currently representing? Will I be working directly with you or with a team member?"

"What is your communication style and frequency? How will you keep me updated throughout the process?"

"Can you explain your fee structure? Are there any additional costs that I should be aware of?"

"What is your strategy for helping me find the right home in my price range?"

"Can you provide references from past clients who have worked with you?"

"How do you handle multiple offers and bidding wars? What strategies do you employ to make my offer stand out?"

**"Can you recommend service providers like mortgage lenders, home inspectors, and contractors if needed?"** <-- Isn't this a conflict of interest?

"What happens if I'm not satisfied with the home after I move in?"

"How do you ensure that I'm seeing homes that truly match my criteria and price range?"

# Random points of interest
