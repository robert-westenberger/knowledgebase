# Mock Requirements
## Overall aesthetic to strive for
![ss_0e3a544323f957abf6b7789223e9586c6c3f3cee.1920x1080.jpg](/ss_0e3a544323f957abf6b7789223e9586c6c3f3cee.1920x1080.jpg)
* You could also draw inspiration from 
 	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshi%27s_Island
  * Older SNES era RPGs like final fantasy, chrono trigger, secret of mana
  
## Icons
For icons, there is a lot of room for artistic / designer interpretation here. I am intentionally not including any actual description, besides the one for "system preferences". 
### Required Icons
* Icon representing a computer
* Icon representing a folder
* Icon representing a folder with documents inside
* Icon representing "system preferences" (so like a cog, or a folder with tools on it or something like that)
* Icon representing a text document
* Icon representing a text editor
* Icon representing a spreadsheet
* Icon representing a submenu (for the start menu)
* Icon representing "help" 
* Icon representing a web browser
* Icon representing a terminal / command line
## Mock Page 1
* The **layout** of the mock should resemble the following screenshot of Windows 95.
![capture.png](/capture.png)

**Only use this first screenshot as a general idea of the layout**.. so for example in the screenshots there are 6 icons (My Computer, Network Neighborhood, Recycle Bin, (C), Control Panel, System), but there does not need to be 6 icons in the mock with those names ( See the above list of required icons to choose from. Where they show up in the mock is not so important)
	* So in the top left there should be a column of icons and text stacked vertically. 
  * There should be a taskbar on the bottom, with the start menu button clicked open. 
  * The start menu should be displayed, to four levels deep like depicted in the screenshot. The start menu items should display some hover state like they are in the screenshot. There will have to be some icons repeated here of course because there won't be enough made for this mock. 
  * The taskbar should have a button to the right of the start menu button containing an icon and some text, which represents an opened program. (In the screenshot, this is the "Control Panel" button on the taskbar). 
  * On the far righthand side of the taskbar, should be a tiny computer icon with a time. 
  * There should be a window on the desktop opened. Buttons / text / scrollbars should show up in the window in the mock in the same place where they do in the screenshot. There should be more icons in the window. The name of the window should match the name of the taskbar button ( in the screenshot, its Control Panel).

## Mock Page 2
The same as page 1, but with the start menu closed. 

## Mock Page 3
Same as mock page 2, but with the window closed and a terminal / command line open. The terminal / command line should not be maximized. It could be a similar size to the window on pages 1 and 2.

## Mock Page 4
The following ui elements, layout doesnt matter. Doesn't even have to be on the "desktop", could just be on a blank screen. The screenshots here are just an example. 
1. Warning message

2. Error message
3. Progress indicator

4. A generic form, inside a window, with the following inputs
	* Primary button
  	* Secondary button
 	 * text input
 	* some checkboxes
 	 * some radio buttons
  	* A select input
## Mock Page 5
I don't really have anything particular in mind here. Austin floated an interesting idea about a window for selecting a screen saver.

Some other possible ideas:
* Some other kind of window open. A paint program, a calculator,
