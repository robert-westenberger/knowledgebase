# Design Patterns
todo: organize
* **Abstraction barriers** can be used to isolate data representation from use and also isolate different design choices and permit different choices in a single program. **Generic functions** can be used to work with data that is represented in different ways. A good technique for this is to work with data objects that have type tags, that is, data objects that include explicit information about how they are to be processed. 
* **Data-directed progamming** is a powerful and convenient implementation strategy for additively assembling systems with generic operations.
