# Overview
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then with a single command, you create and start all ther services from your configuration.

Although Compose works in all environments, it's more focused on development and testing. Using Compose on a production environment is not recommended at all.
