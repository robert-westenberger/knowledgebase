# Lesson 1

## Different Resistors
$220 \Omega$ - Seems brighter than $560 \Omega$?
$1k \Omega$ - Seems dimmer than $560 \Omega$?
$4.7k \Omega$ - Definitely dimmer than $1k \Omega$?
$10k \Omega$ - Extremely dim

## Swapping Anode and Cathode sides of the LEDs
The LED stops emitting any light.

## Swapping positive and negative wires from battery
LED doesnt light up. The current is flowing from positive to negative, but in this configuration the LED's cathode and anode are in the incorrect position in the circuit. Swapping the anode and cathode pins of the LED, the circuit lights up again.

# Lesson 2
## Measurements when LED is on
### Voltage
4.92 V
### Current
milliams = 3.7
### Resistance
