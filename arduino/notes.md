In a circuit, current flows from positive to negative, even though the electrons actually flow the other way.

 When you are connecting a source like a battery, it is a good safety practice to attach the positive terminal to the circuit first and then attach the negative terminal. When you are disconnecting a source, disconnect the negative wire first followed by the positive terminal. This will eliminate the possibility of a short circuit.
 
 In LEDs, the LED anode-cathode differentiation is done via the length of each pin at the end of each diode – the longer pin is usually the anode and the shorter pin – the cathode.
