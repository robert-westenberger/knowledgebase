# Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling means increasing the amount of power on a single machine. It would be like building a tower taller and taller, where the height of the tower represents power of server resources.

## Pros of vertical scaling
* It's easier to implement. You don't need to modify any of your code, it's just a matter of paying more money for better hardware.
## Drawbacks to vertical scaling
* It poses a higher risk for downtime, since there is a single point of failure.
