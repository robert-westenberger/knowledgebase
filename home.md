## Diary
**9-17** - 10 - 12 Today, finished up implementation of singly linked list in C. Tomorrow, finish up more "elegant" node deletion by value procedure for singly-linked lists as suggested by torvalds. 
**9-8** - 10-12 Today, finished notes on algorithm design manual 3rd ed ch 3. Also started on exercise 1 of algorithm design manual 2nd ed ch 3. Tomorrow, finish stack implementation in C. 

**8-23** - 10-12 Tomorrow, continue refactoring /computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/ articles. Delete anything that is fully deprecated.
**8-20** - 10-12 Did exercise 2.17 in algorithm design manual 2nd ed. TODO: finish splitting apart, relocating, and refactoring summation notation articles and algorithmic complexity articles.
**7-23** - 10-12 Started on ch 2 exercises, but was having difficulty manipulating summations. Started reading / taking notes on rosen 8th edition sec 2.4, Sequences and Summations. Tomorrow, continue taking notes and studying the summations part of it.
