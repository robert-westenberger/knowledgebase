## Diary
**5-29** 10 - 12 Did exercise 10 and 13 of 4.3 how to prove it 2nd edition
**5-28** 10 - 12 Tomorrow, finish exercise 10 of Sec 4.3
**5-28** 10 - 12 Finished exercise 10. Started sec 4.3 of how to prove it 2nd edition. Did a few exercises. Tomorrow, do exercises 8/9/10 of sec 4.3
**5-27** 10 - 12 Went over exercise 7 in how to prove it 2nd ed. Started exercise 10. Tomorrow, finish exercise 10.
**5-26** 10 - 12 Reading on composition of relations. Did exercise 4 in How to Prove it 2nd Ed. Tomorrow, go over exercise 7
**5-25** 10 - 12 Reading on relations (How to Prove It 2nd ed) and exercises 1-4. Need a better understanding on composition of a relation with its inverse(4b). 
**5-24** 10 - 12 Reading on relations (Book of Proof 2nd ed) pp 176
**5-18** 10 - 12 Reading on relations (Book of Proof)
**5-18** 10 - 12 Relation rosen 9.1 exercises
**5-14** 10 - 12 Notes on 9.4 closures of relations. For now, skipped Algorithm 1 (A procedure for computing the transitive closure) and Warshall's Algorithm).
**5-13** 10 - 12 Looked more into boolean products of zero-one matrices. Finished taking notes on rosen 9.3, about to start on Rosen 9.4 (Closures of Relations).
**5-12** 10 - 12 Finished taking notes on rosen 9.2, started on 9.3 (matrix representation of relations).. Need better understanding of boolean product of zero-one matrices.
**5-11** 10 - 12 An exercise from rosen 7th 9.1. Starting taking notes on sec 9.2(n-ary relations). Stopped at page 616 in the 8th edition, sec 9.2.5 SQL
**5-10** - 10 - 12 Review MIT OCW 6.042J Fall 2005 In-Class Problems Week 4 Problem 3. Start taking notes / doing exercises in rosen 9.1 
**5-7** - 9:45 - 12 Notes on partially orders on sets, 6042j 2005 notes on relations, Partial order by function, MIT OCW 6.042J Fall 2005 In-Class Problems Week 4 Problem 3
**5-6** - 9:45 - 12 Notes on relations, ended at Schaums Outline of Discrete Mathematics 2.5(pp 27)

**5-4** - 10-12:10 Some binary relations exercises
**5-3** - 10-12:10 Some exercises from rosen 9.1 (relations and their properties). Was taking notes regarding relations on the set of real numbers (#35)
**4-29** - 10-12:40 notes on partial orders and their properties, total orders, products and restrictions of relations. (got to bottom of 2005 6.042j week 4 pdf page 11/21.. digraphs)
**4-28** - Notes on binary relations of functions, equivalence relations, partitions of sets (got to bottom of 2005 6.042j week 4 pdf page 4/21)
**4-27** - Did some WOP exercises. Read about completely tiling a $2^n \times 2^n$ checkerboard with trionimoes with one cell removed. Started taking notes / reading about binary relations (in particular, chap 9.1 of rosen discrete math 8th ed)
**4-25** - stopped at how to prove it 2nd ed 6.4 (strong induction) (updating Strong Induction vs Induction vs Well Ordering Property) Finish reading through / documenting proof of fibonacci formula.
