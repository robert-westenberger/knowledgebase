**5-6** - 9:45 - 12 Notes on relations, ended at Schaums Outline of Discrete Mathematics 2.5(pp 27)
**5-5** - 10-12:00 Notes on relations, ended at bottom of http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ads/s-graphs-of-relations-on-a-set.html
**5-4** - 10-12:10 Some binary relations exercises
**5-3** - 10-12:10 Some exercises from rosen 9.1 (relations and their properties). Was taking notes regarding relations on the set of real numbers (#35)
**4-29** - 10-12:40 notes on partial orders and their properties, total orders, products and restrictions of relations. (got to bottom of 2005 6.042j week 4 pdf page 11/21.. digraphs)
**4-28** - Notes on binary relations of functions, equivalence relations, partitions of sets (got to bottom of 2005 6.042j week 4 pdf page 4/21)
**4-27** - Did some WOP exercises. Read about completely tiling a $2^n \times 2^n$ checkerboard with trionimoes with one cell removed. Started taking notes / reading about binary relations (in particular, chap 9.1 of rosen discrete math 8th ed)
**4-25** - stopped at how to prove it 2nd ed 6.4 (strong induction) (updating Strong Induction vs Induction vs Well Ordering Property) Finish reading through / documenting proof of fibonacci formula.
