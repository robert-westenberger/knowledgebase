## Diary
**8-20** - 10-12 Did exercise 2.17 in algorithm design manual 2nd ed. TODO: finish splitting apart, relocating, and refactoring summation notation articles and algorithmic complexity articles.
**7-23** - 10-12 Started on ch 2 exercises, but was having difficulty manipulating summations. Started reading / taking notes on rosen 8th edition sec 2.4, Sequences and Summations. Tomorrow, continue taking notes and studying the summations part of it.
