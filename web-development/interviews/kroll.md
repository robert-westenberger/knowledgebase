# Tips
Conduct research on the company.  Understand the businesses, history, stock price, etc. 
Be confident and concentrate on what your good at, not what you don’t know.  You need to tell them what you can do not what you can’t.
Be Positive.  Companies are looking for positive people to make a positive impact.
