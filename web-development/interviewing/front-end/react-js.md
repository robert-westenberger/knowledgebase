# What is React and how does it work?
React is a frontend view library created to build complex interactive UIs.


React creates a virtual DOM in memory, and is synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

React is declarative. You tell React what state the UI should be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state.
