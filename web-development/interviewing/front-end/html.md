# What does a DOCTYPE do?
DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for Document Type. A DOCTYPE is always associated to a DTD - for Document Type Definition. 

For webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.

The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
