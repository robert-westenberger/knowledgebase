# What is nodejs?
It's an asynchronous, single threaded event-driven javascript runtime. It's designed to build scalable network applications. 

# What is an error-first callback?
A callback whose first argument is an error object the user has to check if something went wrong. Additional arguments are used to pass data.

# What is callback hell?
Deeply nested callbacks. In order to get out of callback hell, some good solutions are to

1. Use Promises (can chain together .then() ) statements
2. Use Async/await
