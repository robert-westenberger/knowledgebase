# Project Ideas
## Learning Experiences

### Renderer
### TTF renderer
### GIF or JPEG en/decoder
### Video decoder (start with H.261)
### Text Editor
Things to learn:

Data structures for storing the text: array, rope, gap buffer, piece table.
Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.
Design patterns for undo/redo: memento, command.
Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.

### Compiler - Tiny BASIC
Things to learn:

Lexical analysis
Syntactic analysis
Recursive descent parsing
Abstract syntax tree
Semantic analysis
Optimization passes
Code generation

### Mini Operating System
Things to learn:

Cross compiling
Bootloading
BIOS interrupts
x86 modes
Memory management and paging
Scheduling (e.g., round robin)
File systems (e.g., FAT)

### Database
Write a database. Depending on what angle you take, it can look like a compiler (SQL parsing, predicate evaluation, optimizing for index usage), OS (file systems for in-place updates of complex data structures, and scheduling with lock dependencies), distributed systems (consistency and availability tradeoffs across machines, with possible partitions).
And then there's the whole mental model of relational algebra and stream processing of queries.

### 3D renderer

### Shell

### Git

### Virtual Machine / Game emulator
