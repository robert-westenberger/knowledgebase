# Docker 
## Benefits
### Portability ( Consistent / isolated environment)
Once you have tested your containerized application you can deploy it to any other system where Docker is running and you can be sure that your application will perform exactly as it did when you tested it.
### Performance
Although virtual machines are an alternative to containers, the fact that containers do not contain an operating system (whereas virtual machines do) means that containers have much smaller footprints than virtual machines, are faster to create, and quicker to start.

Docker containers are virtually identical in terms of performance in relation to bare metal.
