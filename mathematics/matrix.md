# Matrix
* A matrix / matrices is a rectangular array of numbres symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns.

`matrix.js`

`const matrix = list(`
`	list(1, 2, 3),`
` 	list(4, 5, 6),`
`  	list(7, 8, 9),`
`);`

* Rows and columns of a matrix are n-tuples.![matrix_column_row_diagram.png](/matrix_column_row_diagram.png)
In the above matrix, row 1 (r1) is (6, 2) and row 2 (r2) is (4,3). Column 1 (c1) is (6, 4) and c2 is (2,3).
### Basic matrix operations

* Scalar multiplication is multiplying a real number by a matrix.

 * The **dot product** is the result of summing the products of two equal length n-tuples. For example, the dot product of (2, 5) * (3, 1) = (2 * 3) + (5 * 1) = (6 + 5) = 11.
 
 * Matrix multiplication is the product of two matrices.
