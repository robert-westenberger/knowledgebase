A **logarithm** is simply an inverse exponential function. Saying $b^{x}=y$ is equivalent to saying that $x=\log _{b} y .$ Further, this equivalence is the same as saying $b^{\log _{b} y}=y$. (The $b$ term is known as the **base** of the logarithm).

Logarithms arise in any process where things are repeatedly halved.
