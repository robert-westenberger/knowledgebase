# 3D Cartesian Space
Many, but not all, concepts in 2D directly extend into 3D. We frequently use 2D to establish an understanding of a problem and develop a solution, and then extend that into 3D.

## Extra Dimension, Extra Axis
3D is defined by 3 mutually perpendicular axes. 

In 3D, x and y aren't necessarily the same as they are in 2D. In 3D, any pair of axes defines a plane that contains the two axes and is perpendicular to the third axis. 

For example, the plane containing the x- and y-axes is
the xy plane, which is perpendicular to the z-axis. The xz plane is perpendicular to the y-axis, and the yz plane is perpendicular to the x-axis. Each are a 2D Cartesian coordinate space in its own right.
