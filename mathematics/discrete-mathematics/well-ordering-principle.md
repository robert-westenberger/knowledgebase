The Well Ordering Principle is
$$
\text { Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element. }
$$

or 
$$
\text { Every nonempty subset of } \mathbb{N} \text { has a smallest element. }
$$
note how it only applies to sets with nonnegative integers.


## Using WOP to prove $\sqrt 2$ is irrational
By the WOP, we can assume that for any positive integers $m$ and $n$,  the fraction $m/n$ can be written in lowest terms.. in the form $m^{\prime} / n^{\prime}$ where $m^{\prime}$ and $n^{\prime}$ are positive integers with no common prime factors. How do we know this is possible?

Suppose to the contrary that there are positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that the fraction $m/n$ cannot be written in lowest terms. 

Let $C = \{ \text{positive integers that are numerators of such fractions} \}$.
