# Types of Closures

If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, it may or may not have some property $\textbf P$, such as reflexivity, symmetry, or transitivity. When $R$ does not enjoy propety $\textbf P$, we would like to find the smallest relation $S$ on $A$ with property $\textbf P$ that contains $R$.
If $R$ is a relation on a set $A$, then the **closure** of $R$ with respect to $P$, if it exists, is the relation $S$ on $A$ with property $P$ that ocntains $R$ and is a subset of every subset $A \times A$ containing $R$ with property $P$.
