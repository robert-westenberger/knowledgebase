A set is a bunch of objects, which are called **elements** of the set. 


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{N} &=\{0,1,2,3, \ldots\} & & \text {the natural numbers } \\
C &=\{\text { red, blue, yellow }\} & & \text {primary colors } \\
D &=\{\text { Teddy, Sheba, Bella }\} & & \text {dead pets } \\ 
P &=\{\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{b, c\}\} & & \text {a set of sets}
\end{aligned}
$$

The order of elements in a set don't matter. 

Any object only appears in a set once (it's either in the set or not).

The expression $e \in S$ asserts that $e$ is an element of set $S$.

### Popular Sets

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\textbf { symbol } & \textbf { set } & \textbf { elements } \\
\emptyset & \text { the empty set } & \text { none } \\
\mathbb{N} & \text { nonnegative integers } & \{0,1,2,3, \ldots\} \\
\mathbb{Z} & \text { integers } & \{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots\} \\
\mathbb{Q} & \text { rational numbers } & \frac{1}{2},-\frac{5}{3}, 16, \text { etc. } \\
\mathbb{R} & \text { real numbers } & \pi, e,-9, \sqrt{2}, \text { etc. } \\
\mathbb{C} & \text { complex numbers } & i, \frac{19}{2}, \sqrt{2}-2 i, \text { etc. }
\end{array}
$$

A superscript + or - restricts a set to positive or negative elements.

### Comparing and Combining Sets

#### Subset 
$S \subseteq T$ indicates that S is a subset of T (every element of S is an element of T).

$S \subset T$ indicates that S is a subset of T, but the two are not equal.
