A set is a bunch of objects, which are called **elements** of the set. 


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{N} &=\{0,1,2,3, \ldots\} & & \text {the natural numbers } \\
C &=\{\text { red, blue, yellow }\} & & \text {primary colors } \\
D &=\{\text { Teddy, Sheba, Bella }\} & & \text {dead pets } \\ 
P &=\{\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{b, c\}\} & & \text {a set of sets}
\end{aligned}
$$

The order of elements in a set don't matter. 

Any object only appears in a set once (it's either in the set or not).

The expression $e \in S$ asserts that $e$ is an element of set $S$.
