# Forward and Backward Reasoning
**Forward reasoning** is starting with the premises, and using the premises together with axioms and known theorems to take a sequence of logically connected steps to lead to a conclusion (for a direct proof). Similarly, with indirect reasoning you can start with the negation of the conclusion and obtain the negation of the premises.

**Backward reasoning** to prove a statement $q$ is to find a statement $p$ that we can use to prove $p \rarr q$.
