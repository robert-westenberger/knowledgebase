# Relations between two sets
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A relation from $A$ into $B$ is any subset of $A \times B$.

## Examples of relations between two sets
### Example
Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{4,5\}$. Then  $\{(1,4),(2,4),(3,5)\}$ is a relation from $A$ into $B$. There would be $64$ possible relations for these two sets.

### Divisibility Exmaple
Let $A=\{2,3,5,6\}$ and define a relation $r$ from $A$ into $A$ by $(a,b) \in r$ iff $a \mid b$. The set of pairs that qualify for membership is $r=\{(2,2),(3,3),(5,5),(6,6),(2,6),(3,6)\}$
