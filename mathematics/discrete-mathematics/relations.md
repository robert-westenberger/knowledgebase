# Relations between two sets
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A relation from $A$ into $B$ is any subset of $A \times B$.

## Examples of relations between two sets
Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{4,5\}$. Then  $\{(1,4),(2,4),(3,5)\}$ is a relation from $A$ into $B$. There would be $64$ possible relations for these two sets.
