# Directed Graph / Digraph
A directed graph is the same as a binary relation on a set $A$, but we picture the digraph geometrically by representing elements of $A$ as points on the plane, with an arrow from the point for $a$ to the point for $b$ exactly when $aRb$. The elements of $A$ are referred to as the vertices of the digraph.

Below, the divisibility relation on $\{1,2, \ldots, 12\}$ is represented by the following digraph:
