A **sequence** is a function from a subset of the set of integers (usually either the set $\{0,1,2, \ldots\}$ or the set $\{1,2,3, \ldots\})$ to a set $S$. We use the notation $a_{n}$ to denote the image of the integer $n$. We call $a_{n}$ a term of the sequence.

Unlike sets, the elements in a sequence can be **duplicate** and they have a particular **order**. 


# Geometric Progression
A **geometric progression** is a sequence of the form
$$
a, a r, a r^{2}, \ldots, a r^{n}, \ldots
$$
where the **initial term** $a$ and the **common ratio** $r$ are real numbers.

It is a discrete analogue of the exponential function $f(x)=ar^x$.


# Arithmetic Progression
An **arithmetic progression** is a sequence of the form
$$
a, a+d, a+2 d, \ldots, a+n d, \ldots
$$
where the **initial term** $a$ and the **common difference** $d$ are real numbers.

It is a discrete analogue of the linear function $f(x)=dx+a$.
