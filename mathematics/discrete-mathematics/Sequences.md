# Sequences
A sequence is a list of objects called its components, members, or elements. 
Short sequences are typically described by listing the elements between parentheses, for example $(a,b,c)$ is a sequence that has $3$ elements.

Unlike sets, the elements in a sequence can be **duplicate** and they have a particular **order**. 

Texts differ on the notation of an empty sequence, but a common one is $\lambda$.

Sequences also can be combined with a **Cartesian Product** just like sets. For example, $\mathbb{N} \times\{a, b\}$ is the set of all pairs whose first element is a nonnegative integer and whose second element is an $a$ or a $b$.

$$
\mathbb{N} \times\{a, b\}=\{(0, a),(0, b),(1, a),(1, b),(2, a),(2, b), \ldots\}
$$

A product of $n$ copies of a set $S$ is denoted $S^n$. For example, $\{0,1\}^{3}$ is the set of all $3$-bit sequences:
$$
\{0,1\}^{3}=\{(0,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,1,0),(0,1,1),(1,0,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)\}
$$
