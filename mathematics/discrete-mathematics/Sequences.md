# Sequences
A sequence is a list of objects called its components, members, or elements. 
Short sequences are typically described by listing the elements between parentheses, for example $(a,b,c)$ is a sequence that has $3$ elements.

Unlike sets, the elements in a sequence can be **duplicate** and they have a particular **order**. 

Texts differ on the notation of an empty sequence, but a common one is $\lambda$.

Sequences also can be combined with a **Cartesian Product** just like sets.
