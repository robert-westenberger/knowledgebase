# Partial Orderings

A relation $R$ on a set $S$ is called a partial ordering or partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A set $S$ together with a partial ordering $R$ is called a partially ordered set, or poset, and is denoted by $(S, R)$. Members of $S$ are called elements of the poset.
