A **function** assigns an element of one set, the **domain**, to elements of another set called the **codomain**.

The notation 
$$
f: A \rightarrow B
$$
indicates that $f$ is a function with domain $A$ and codomain $B$.

The notation 
$$
f(a)=b
$$
indicates that $f$ assigns the element $b \in B$ to $a$. Here $b$ would be called the $value$ of $f$ at argument $a$.
## Defining Functions
Every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words. 

Functions are often defined by formulas, for example $f_{1}(x)::=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$. Notice how this won't assign a value for every element in the domain (value at 0 will be undefined). 

**Support** of the function - The set of domain elements for which a function is defined.

**Total function** - A function that assigns a value to every element of its domain.

A function with a finite domain could be represented with a with a truth table to show the value of the function at each element of the domain. For example, a function $f_{4}(P, Q)$ where $P$ and $Q$ are propositional variables is specified by: 
$$
\begin{array}{|cc|c|}
\hline P & Q & f_{4}(P, Q) \\
\hline \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{F} \\
\hline \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

## Image and Inverse Image
Given a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, the **image** (or **range**) of a function is the set of all output values it may produce. The **image** of set $A$ is the **range** of $f$, which is the set of all possible images that $f$ can assume.

More formally, given a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, and $C \subseteq A$, the **image of** $c$ **under** $f$ is defined as 
$$
f(C)=\{f(x) \mid x \in C\}
$$
In other words, $f(C)$ is the set of all the images of the elements of $C$.

Things to remember

1. It is about the image of a subset  ùê∂  of the domain of  ùê¥ . Do not confuse it with the image of an element  ùë•  from  ùê¥ 
2. Therefore, do not merely say ‚Äúthe image.‚Äù Be specific: the image of an element, or the image of a subset.
3. Better yet: include the notation  ùëì(ùë•)  or  ùëì(ùê∂)  in the discussion.
4. While  ùëì(ùë•)  is an element in the codomain,  ùëì(ùê∂)  is a subset of the codomain.
5. Perhaps, the most important thing to remember is:
If $y \in f(C)$, then $y \in B$, and then there exists an $x \in C$ such that $f(x) = y$.


### Examples
#### Example 1
Let the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined by 
$$
f(x)=x^{2}
$$
We find the range of $F$ is $\lbrack 0, \infty)$ We also have, for example, $f(\lbrack 2, \infty))=\lbrack 4, \infty)$. It is clear that $f$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.
#### Example 2
Let the function $g: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be defined by:

$$g(n)=n+3$$

we find the range of $g$ is $\mathbb Z$, and $g(\mathbb{N})=\{4,5,6, \ldots\}$. The function $g$ is both one-to-one and onto. 

#### Example 3
Consider the function $f:\{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \rightarrow\{a, b, c, d\}$ given by

$$
f=\left(\begin{array}{llllll}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
a & a & b & b & b & c
\end{array}\right)
$$
Find $f(\{1,2,3\}), f^{-1}(\{a, b\})$ and $f^{-1}(d)$

##### Solution
$f(\{1,2,3\})=\{a, b\}$ since $a$ and $b$ are the elements in the codomain to which $f$ sends 1 and 2.
$f^{-1}(\{a, b\})=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ since these are exactly the elements that $f$ sends to $a$ and $b$.
$f^{-1}(d)=\emptyset$ since $d$ is not in the range of $f$.
## Function Composition
Composing functions $f$ and $f$ means that $f$ is applied to some argument, $x$, to produce $f(x)$, and then $g$ is applied to that result to produce $g(f(x))$. 

For functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$, the **composition** $g \circ f$, of $g$ with $f$ is defined to be the function from $A$ to $C$ defined by the rule: 
$$
(g \circ f)(x)::=g(f(x))
$$
for all $x \in A$.
