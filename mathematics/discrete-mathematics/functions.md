A **function** assigns an element of one set, the **domain**, to elements of another set called the **codomain**.

The notation 
$$
f: A \rightarrow B
$$
indicates that $f$ is a function domain $A$ and codomain $B$.

The notation 
$$
f(a)=b
$$
indicates that $f$ assigns the element $b \in B$ to $a$. Here $b$ would be called the $value$ of $f$ at argument $a$.
## Defining Functions
Every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words. 

Functions are often defined by formulas, for example $f_{1}(x)::=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$. Notice how this won't assign a value for every element in the domain (value at 0 will be undefined). 

**Support** of the function - The set of domain elements for which a function is defined.

**Total function** - A function that assigns a value to every element of its domain.

A function with a finite domain could be represented with a with a truth table to show the value of the function at each element of the domain. For example, a function $f_{4}(P, Q)$ where $P$ and $Q$ are propositional variables is specified by: 
$$
\begin{array}{|cc|c|}
\hline P & Q & f_{4}(P, Q) \\
\hline \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{F} \\
\hline \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{T} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{F} & \mathbf{T} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

## Image and Inverse Image
Given a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, the **image** of a function is the set of all output values it may produce. The **image** of set $A$ is the $range$ of $f$, which is the set of all possible images that $f$ can assume.
