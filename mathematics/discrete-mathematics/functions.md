A **function** assigns an element of one set, the **domain**, to elements of another set called the **codomain**.

The notation 
$$
f: A \rightarrow B
$$
indicates that $f$ is a function domain $A$ and codomain $B$.

The notation 
$$
f(a)=b
$$
indicates that $f$ assigns the element $b \in B$ to $a$. Here $b$ would be called the $value$ of $f$ at argument $a$.

Functions are often defined by formulas, for example $f_{1}(x)::=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$. Notice how this won't assign a value for every element in the domain (value at 0 will be undefined).

A function with a finite domain could be represented with a with a truth table to show the value of the function at each element of the domain.
