## Tell why a function is partial
Remember that a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ has the property that each element of $A$ has been assigned to exactly one element of $B$.
### 1 
Why is $f$ not a function from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{R}$ if 
**a)** $f(x)=1 / x$
**b)** $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$
**c)** $f(x)=\pm \sqrt{\left(x^{2}+1\right)}$

#### Solution
**a)** $f(0)$ is not defined for any value.
**b)** Negative square roots are undefined, or complex numbers (not real numbers).
**c)** There are multiple values in the domain that map to single values of the codomain.
