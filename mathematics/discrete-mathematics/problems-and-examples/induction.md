### 1
There are infinitely many stations on a train route. Suppose
that the train stops at the first station and suppose
that if the train stops at a station, then it stops at the next
station. Show that the train stops at all stations.
#### Solution
We must prove that for all $n \ge 1, P(n)$ where $P(n)$ is the statement that if the train stops at the $n$th station, then it must also stop at the $n+1$th station.
