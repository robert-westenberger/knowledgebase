# Section 1.7 Introduction to Proofs

## Exercise 5
Prove that if $m + n$ and $n + p$ are even integers, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are integers, then $m + p$ is even. What kind of proof did you use?
### Solution
Assume for integers $m$, $n$, and $p$, $m+n$ and $n+p$ are even integers. That means that there are some integers a and b where $m+n$ = 2a and $n+p=2b$.

Adding those two together, we get 
$$
\begin{aligned}
m+n+n+p&=2a+2b \\
m + 2n + p &= 2a+2b
\end{aligned}
$$
