# Determine if relations on a set are reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive

## Rosen 7th Edition Sec 9.1 Exercise 3
For each of these relations on the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$, decide
whether it is reflexive, whether it is symmetric, whether
it is antisymmetric, and whether it is transitive.
**a)** $\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4)\}$
**b)** $\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)\}$
**c)** $\{(2,4),(4,2)\}$
**d)** $\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)\}$
**e)** $\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)\}$
**f)** $\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,1),(3,4)\}$.

### Soln
**a)** Transitive.
**b)** This is reflexive since it contains $(a, a) \in R$ for every $a \in A$. It is also symmetric since $(2,1)$ is in $R$ when $(1, 2)$ is. It is not antisymmetric since $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ are in the relation. It is transitive since $(1,2)$ and $(2, 1)$ are in the relation then $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ are in the relation as well.
**c)** 
**d)** 
**e)** 
**f)**
