## List members of sets

### 1 
List the members of these sets.
**a)** $\left\{x \mid x\right.$ is a real number such that $\left.x^{2}=1\right\}$
**b)** $\{x \mid x$ is a positive integer less than 12$\}$
**c)** $\{x \mid x$ is the square of an integer and $x<100\}$
**d)** $\left\{x \mid x\right.$ is an integer such that $\left.x^{2}=2\right\}$

#### Solution

**a)** $\{-1, 1 \}$
**b)** $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \}$
**c)** $\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 \}$
**d)** $\emptyset$

### 3 
For each of these pairs of sets, determine whether the first
is a subset of the second, the second is a subset of the first,
or neither is a subset of the other.
**a)** the set of airline flights from New York to New Delhi,
the set of nonstop airline flights from New York to
New Delhi
**b)** the set of people who speak English, the set of people
who speak Chinese
**c)** the set of flying squirrels, the set of living creatures
that can fly
#### Solution
**a)** Every element in the second set is in the first set, so the second set is a subset of the first set. (the set of airline flights from new york to new delhi contains all nonstop flights + flights with layovers). 
**b)** neither
**c)** the first is a subset of the second, and not vice versa.

### 5
Determine whether each of these pairs of sets are equal.
**a)** $\{1,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5\},\{5,3,1\}$
**b)** $\{\{1\}\},\{1,\{1\}\}$
**c)** $\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}$.
#### Solution
**a)** equal (duplicates and order dont matter)
**b)** not equal - first set has 1 element second has 2
**c)** not equal

### 21
Find the power set of each of these sets, where $a$ and $b$
are distinct elements.

**a)** $\{a\}$ 
**b)** $\{a, b\}$ 
**c)** $\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$
