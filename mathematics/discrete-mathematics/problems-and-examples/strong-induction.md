Use strong induction to show that if you can run one mile or two miles, and if you can always run two more miles once you have run a specified number of miles, then you can run any number of miles.

### Solution
Let $P(n)$ be the statement that you can run $n$ miles. We want to prove $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$. 

**Basis Step:** $P(1)$ and $P(2)$ are true. 

**Inductive Step:** Fix $k \ge 2$ and assume $P(j)$ is true for all $j \le k$. We want to show $P(k+1)$ is true. Since $k \ge 2$, $k-1$ is a positive integer less than or equal to $k$. By the inductive hypothesis, we know that $P(k-1)$ is true. That is, we know that  you can run $k-1$ miles. Since "you can always run two more miles once you have run a specified number of miles", we know that you can run $(k-1)+2=k+1$ miles. This is $P(k+1)$.
