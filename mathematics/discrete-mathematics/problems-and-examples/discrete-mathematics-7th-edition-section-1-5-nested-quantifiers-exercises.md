# 1.5 Nested Quantifiers

## 1 
Translate these statements into English, where the domain
for each variable consists of all real numbers.
**a** $\forall x \exists y(x<y)$
**b** $\forall x \forall y(((x \geq 0) \wedge(y \geq 0)) \rightarrow(x y \geq 0))$
**c** $\forall x \forall y \exists z(x y=z)$

### Solution
a. For every $x$ there exists a $y$ where $x$ is less than $y$
b. For every $x$ and every $y$ if $x$ is positive and $y$ is positive then the product of $x$ and $y$ will be positive.
c. For all real numbers $x$ and $y$ there exists a number $z$ that is the product of $x$ and $y$.

## 3 
Let $Q(x, y)$ be the statement “x has sent an e-mail message
to y,” where the domain for both x and y consists of
all students in your class. Express each of these quantifications
in English.
a) $\exists x \exists y Q(x, y)$
b) $\exists x \forall y Q(x, y)$
c) $\forall x \exists y Q(x, y \mid)$
d) $\exists y \forall x Q(x, y)$
e) $\forall y \exists x Q(x, y)$
f) $\forall x \forall y Q(x, y)$
### Solution
a) There exists a student x who has emailed another student y
b) There exists a student x who has emailed every other student
c) All students have emailed at least one student in class.
d) There exists a student y who has received an email from everybody
e) Every student has received an email from student X
f) All students have sent and received an email from eachother
