## Discrete Mathematics with Applications 5th Edition (Epp) Section 8.5 Exercise 38
Prove that a partially ordered set is totally ordered if, and only if, it is a chain.

### Solution
Suppose $A$ is a partially ordered set with respect to a relation $\preceq$. By definition of total order, $A$ is totally ordered if, and only if, any two elements of $A$ are comparable. By definition of chain, this is true if, and only if, $A$ is a chain.

## Discrete Mathematics with Applications 5th Edition (Epp) Section 8.5 Exercise 39
Suppose that $A$ is a totally ordered set. Use mathematical induction to prove that for any integer $n \geq 1$, every subset of $A$ with $n$ elements has both a least element and a greatest element.
