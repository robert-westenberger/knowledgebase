## Discrete Mathematics with Applications 5th Edition (Epp) Section 8.5 Exercise 38
Prove that a partially ordered set is totally ordered if, and only if, it is a chain.

### Solution
Suppose $A$ is a partially ordered set with respect to a relation $\preceq$. By definition of total order, $A$ is totally ordered if, and only if, any two elements of $A$ are comparable. By definition of chain, this is true if, and only if, $A$ is a chain.
