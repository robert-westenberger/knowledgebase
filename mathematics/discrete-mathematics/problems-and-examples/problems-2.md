## Chapter 1 Exercise 9
Suppose that during the most recent fiscal year, the annual
revenue of Acme Computer was 138 billion dollars
and its net profit was 8 billion dollars, the annual revenue
of Nadir Software was 87 billion dollars and its net profit
was 5 billion dollars, and the annual revenue of Quixote
Media was 111 billion dollars and its net profit was
13 billion dollars. Determine the truth value of each of

**b)** Nadir Software had the lowest net profit and Acme
Computer had the largest annual revenue.
**c)** Acme Computer had the largest net profit or Quixote
Media had the largest net profit.
**d)** If Quixote Media had the smallest net profit, then
Acme Computer had the largest annual revenue.
**e)** Nadir Software had the smallest net profit if and only
if Acme Computer had the largest annual revenue.

### Solution

## Chapter 1 Exercise 11

Jersey shore is allowed” and “Sharks have been spotted
near the shore,” respectively. Express each of these compound
propositions as an English sentence.
**a)** ¬q 
**b)** p ∧ q 
**c)** ¬p ∨ q
**d)** p → ¬q 
**e)** ¬q → p 
**f)** ¬p → ¬q
**g)** p ↔ ¬q 
**h)** ¬p ∧ (p∨ ¬q)

### Solution

## Chapter 1 Exercise 13
Let p and q be the propositions
p: It is below freezing.
q: It is snowing.
Write these propositions using p and q and logical connectives
(including negations).
**a)** It is below freezing and snowing.
**b)** It is below freezing but not snowing.
**c)** It is not below freezing and it is not snowing.
**d)** It is either snowing or below freezing (or both).
**e)** If it is below freezing, it is also snowing.
**f)** Either it is below freezing or it is snowing, but it is
not snowing if it is below freezing.
**g)** That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient
for it to be snowing.

is true or false.
**a)** If 1 + 1 = 2, then 2 + 2 = 5.
**b)** If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 4.
**c)** If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 5.
**d)** If monkeys can fly, then 1 + 1 = 3.
