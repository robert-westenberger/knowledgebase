# Problems and Strategies
## Determine whether compound proposition is satisfiable
Keep plugging in truth values for the propositional variables until you find variables that make the proposition true. We only need to find one case in order for a proposition to be satisfiable. 

We don't have to blindly plug in truth values - we can reason about the different propositions in the compound proposition.
