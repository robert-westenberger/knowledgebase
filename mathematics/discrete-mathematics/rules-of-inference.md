# Rules of Inference

An **argument** is a sequence of statements that end with a conclusion. 

A **valid** argument is one where the conclusion, or final statement of the argument, follows from the truth of the preceding statements, or **premises**.

An argument is in **argument form** when it's propositions are changed to propositional variables. An argument form is valid no matter which particular propositions are subsituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true.
