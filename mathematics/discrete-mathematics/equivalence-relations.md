# Equivalence Relations
A relation on a set $A$ is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Two elements $a$ and $b$ that are related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The notation $a \sim b$ is often used to denote that $a$ and $b$ are equivalent elements with respect to a particular equivalence relation.
