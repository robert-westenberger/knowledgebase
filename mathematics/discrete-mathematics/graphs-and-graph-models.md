# Graphs and Graph Models

A **graph** $G=(V, E)$ consists of $V$, a nonempty set of **vertices** (or **nodes**) and $E$, a set of **edges**. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its **endpoints**. An edge is said to **connect** its endpoints.

A graph can either be **finite** or **infinite**. They have finite vertex set or infinite vertex set respectively.
