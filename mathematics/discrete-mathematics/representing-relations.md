# Representing Relations Using Matrices
A relation between finite sets can be represented using a zero-one matrix.

Support $R$ is ar elation from $A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}\right\}$ to $B=\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n}\right\}$. The relation $R$ can be represented by the matrix $\mathbf{M}_{R}=\left[m_{i j}\right]$, where 

$$
m_{i j}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
1 \text { if }\left(a_{i}, b_{j}\right) \in R, \\
0 \text { if }\left(a_{i}, b_{j}\right) \notin R
\end{array}\right.
$$
