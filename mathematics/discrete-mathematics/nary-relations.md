# n-ary Relations
Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be sets. An **n-ary relation** on these sets is a subset of $A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \cdots \times A_{n}$. The sets $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}$ are called the **domains** of the relation, and $n$ is called its **degree**.

For example, let $R_1$ bbe the relation $\mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N}$ consisting of triples $(a,b,c)$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers with $a \lt b \lt c$. Then $(1,2,3) \in R$, but $(2,4,3) \notin R$. The degree of the relation is $3$. Its domains are all equal to the set of natural numbers.

# Databases and Relations
The **relational data model** is based on the concept of a relation.
