# Counting Special Relations

Count relations satisfying specific properties such as reflexivity, symmetricity, etc. 

Let $A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right\}$ and we represent $A \times A$ as a matrix such that $i^{t h}$ row $j^{\text {th }}$ column represents $\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\right), 1 \leq i, j \leq n$. Observe that the matrix has $n^{2}$ elements.
