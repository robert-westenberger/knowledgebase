# Power Functions
Let $a$ be any nonnegative real number. Define $p_{a}$, the **power function with exponent** $\boldsymbol{a}$, as follows:
$p_{a}(x)=x^{a}$ for each nonnegative real number $x$.

# Floor Functions

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(x)&=\lfloor x\rfloor \\
&=\text { the greatest integer that is less than or equal to } x \\
&\text { = the unique integer } n \text { such that } n \leq x<n+1
\end{aligned}
$$
