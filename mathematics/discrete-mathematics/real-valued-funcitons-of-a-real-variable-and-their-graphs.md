# Power Functions
Let $a$ be any nonnegative real number. Define $p_{a}$, the **power function with exponent** $\boldsymbol{a}$, as follows:
$p_{a}(x)=x^{a}$ for each nonnegative real number $x$.

# Floor Functions

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(x)&=\lfloor x\rfloor \\
&=\text { the greatest integer that is less than or equal to } x \\
&\text { = the unique integer } n \text { such that } n \leq x<n+1
\end{aligned}
$$

# Graph of a Multiple of a Function
A **multiple** of a function is obtained by multiplying every value of the function by a fixed number. To understand the concept of $O$-notation, it is helpful to understand the relation between the graph of a function and the graph of a multiple of the function.

Let $f$ be a real-valued function of a real variable and let $M$ be any real number. The function $M f$, called the **multiple of** $\boldsymbol{f}$ **by** $\boldsymbol{M}$ or $\boldsymbol{M}$ **times** $\boldsymbol{f}$, is the real-valued function with the same domain as $f$ that is defined by the rule
$$
(M f)(x)=M \cdot(f(x)) \quad \text { for each } x \in \text { domain of } f
$$

# Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Consider the absolute value function, $A$, defined as follows: 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
A(x)=|x|=\left\{\begin{aligned}
x & \text { if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text { if } x<0
\end{aligned}\right.\\
\text { for each real number } x
\end{array}
$$

When $x \geq 0$, the graph of $A$ is the same as the graph of $y=x$, the straight line with slope 1 that passes through the origin $(0,0)$. For $x<0$, the graph of $A$ is the same as the graph of $y=-x$, which is the straight line with slope $-1$ that passes through $(0,0) .$ (See below graph of absolute value function)
