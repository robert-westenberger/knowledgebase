# Tiling a checkerboard with triominoes
A *trionimo* (alternately *tromino*) is made up of three attached squares, which can be of two types: ![trionimoes.png](/trionimoes.png)

If one square is removed from a $2^n \times 2^n$ checkerboard (with $n \ge 1$), it can be completely covered by L-shaped trionimoes.

**Theorem:** For any integer $n \ge 1$, if one square is removed from a $2^n \times 2^n$ checkerboard, the remaining squares can be completely covered by L-shaped trionimoes.
