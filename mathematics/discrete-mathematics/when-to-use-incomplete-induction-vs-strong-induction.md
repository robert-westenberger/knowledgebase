# When To Use Incomplete Induction
Use mathematical induction when it is straightforward to prove that $P(k) \rarr P(k+1)$ is true for all positive integers $k$. 

# When To Use Strong Induction
When you see how to prove $P(k+1)$ is true from the assumption that $P(j)$ is true for all positive integers $j$ not exceeding $k$, but yo ucannot see how to prove that $P(k+1)$ follows from just $P(k)$.
