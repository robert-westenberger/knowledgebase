# Propositional Logic

## Propositions
A **proposition** is a statement that is either true or false. 

A proposition is **atomic** if it cannot be broken down into smaller statements / propositions. Otherwise, it is called **molecular**. 

## Predicates
A **predicate** can be understood as a proposition whose truth depeonds on the value of one or more variables. "n is a perfect square" is a predicate, since you don't know its true or false until a value for n is provided.
