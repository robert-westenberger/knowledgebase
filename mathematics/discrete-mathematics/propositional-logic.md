# Propositional Logic

## Propositions
A statement that is either true or false. 

A proposition is **atomic** if it cannot be broken down into smaller statements / propositions. Otherwise, it is called **molecular**. 

## Predicates
A proposition whose truth depeonds on the value of one or more variables. "n is a perfect square" is a predicate, since you don't know its true or false until a value for n is provided.

## Logical Connectives
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\text { Symbol } & \text { Meaning } \\
\hline \vee & \text { or } \\
\wedge & \text { and } \\
\rarr & \text { implication (or conditional) } \\
\leftrightarrow & \text { biconditional } \\
\neg & \text { not }
\end{array}
$$

$P \vee Q$ is read "P or Q"
$P \wedge Q$ is read "P and Q"
$P \rarr Q$ is read "if P then Q"
$P \leftrightarrow Q$ is read "P if and only if Q"
$\neg P$ is read "not P"

Note that the OR is the **inclusive or** and that $P \vee Q$ is true when both P and Q are true.
