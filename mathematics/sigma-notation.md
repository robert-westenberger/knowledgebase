# Sigma Notation 


$$
\sum_{i=m}^{n} a_{i}=a_{m}+a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}+a_{n}
$$

* $i$ is the **index of summation**
* $a_i$ is an index variable representing each term of the sum.
* $m$ is the **lower bound of summation**
* $n$ is the **upper bound of summation**
* The $i=m$ under the summation symbol means that the index $i$ starts out equal to $m$.
* The index, $i$, is incremented by one for each successive term, stopping whne $i=n$.

The above summation is read, "sum to $a_i$, from $i=m$ to $n$".
