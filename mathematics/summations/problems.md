# Finding the Closed Form of a Summation or Multiple Summation
## General Strategy for finding closed form of a multiple summation
Repeatedly convert the rightmost / "innermost" sum to closed form. Get the summations into a form where we can use common closed sum formulas. This can be done through distributivity (factor out constants), associativity (splitting and combiing sums), commutativity (reordering sums).
