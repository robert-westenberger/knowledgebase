# Finding the Closed Form of a Summation or Multiple Summation
## General Strategy for finding closed form of a multiple summation
Repeatedly convert the rightmost / "innermost" sum to closed form. Get the summations into a form where we can use common closed sum formulas. This can be done through distributivity (factor out constants), associativity (splitting and combining sums), commutativity (reordering sums).

Be sure to adjust the use of closed sum formulas with the bounds of summation in mind. The index of summation can be adjusted to be able to use summation formulas more easily.
