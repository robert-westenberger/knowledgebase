# What the hell is a derivative
A derivative of a function gives you the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at any given point. In other words, it tells you how the function is changing at that specific point.

It's the instantaneous rate of change of something.


Algebra is useful for calculating the average speed of Usain Bolt during a 100 meter dash. We know it took him 9.58 seconds, and we can calculate his average speed by dividing the change in distance  by the change in time.

Using that example, if we were to graph it with y as the distance and x as the time, the slope from the origin to the destination (starting time + position to end time + position, e.g. the starting line and the finish line at 9.58 seconds) is his average speed ( 10.4 meters per second , roughly 23.5 mph)

On a graph though, in reality Usain is not travelling from the starting line to the finish line at a constant rate of speed. He is accelerating off the line, eventually reaches a top speed and presumably croses the finish line at that top speed. The slope of the graph actually has a curve to it, because at the beginning he is going slower and at the end he is going faster.

We want to see what happens as the $\Delta x$ gets smaller and smaller, $\Delta y$ will get smaller and smaller and we'll get a better approximation of both values and we'll be able to approximate the instantaneous rate of change. 

We actually want to take the limit as the change in x approaches 0.

$$
\lim _{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \rightarrow \frac{d y}{d x}
$$

Essentially, calculus allows us to calculate the slope of a curved line. The slope of a curved line is constantly changing, unlike that of a straight line.
