# What the hell is a derivative
A derivative of a function gives you the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at any given point. In other words, it tells you how the function is changing at that specific point.

It's the instantaneous rate of change of something.

Algebra is useful for calculating the average speed of Usain Bolt during a 100 meter dash. We know it took him 9.58 seconds, and we can calculate his average speed by dividing the change in distance  by the change in time.

Using that example, if we were to graph it with y as the distance and x as the time, the slope from the origin to the destination (starting time + position to end time + position, e.g. the starting line and the finish line at 9.58 seconds) is his average speed ( 10.4 meters per second )
