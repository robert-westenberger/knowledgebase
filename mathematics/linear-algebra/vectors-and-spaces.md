# Vectors & Spaces


## Vectors
* A **vector** is something that has both **magnitude** and **direction**. 
* Velocity is a vector for example. It has a speed and a direction. 

#### Linear combinations
* Vectors are added with *v+w*. We multiply them by numbers c and d to get *cv* and *dw*.
$$ cv + dw = c\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1 
\end{bmatrix} +d
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
3 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
c + 2d \\
c + 3d 
\end{bmatrix}$$
