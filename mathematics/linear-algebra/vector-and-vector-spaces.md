# Vectors and Vector Spaces

A vector space consists of a set V (elements of V are called vectors), a field F (elements of F are called scalars), and two operations
• An operation called vector addition that takes two vectors v, w ∈ V ,
and produces a third vector, written v + w ∈ V .
• An operation called scalar multiplication that takes a scalar c ∈ F and
a vector v ∈ V , and produces a new vector, written cv ∈ V .
which satisfy the following conditions (called axioms).
1. Associativity of vector addition: (u + v) + w = u + (v + w) for all
u, v, w ∈ V .
2. Existence of a zero vector: There is a vector in V , written 0 and called
the zero vector, which has the property that u + 0 = u for all u ∈ V
3. Existence of negatives: For every u ∈ V , there is a vector in V , written
−u and called the negative of u, which has the property that u +
(−u) = 0.
4. Associativity of multiplication: (ab)u = a(bu) for any a, b ∈ F and
u ∈ V .
5. Distributivity: (a + b)u = au + bu and a(u + v) = au + av for all
a, b ∈ F and u, v ∈ V .
6. Unitarity: 1u = u for all u ∈ V .
