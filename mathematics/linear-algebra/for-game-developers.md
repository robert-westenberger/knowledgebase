# Vectors
In games, vectors are used to store positions, directions, and velocities. Below are some 2D examples.

The position vector indicates the man is standing 2 units east and 1 unit north of the origin. The velocity vector indicates that in one unit of time, the plane will be 2 units west and 3 units north of it's origin. The direction vector tells us the gun is pointed to the right.
