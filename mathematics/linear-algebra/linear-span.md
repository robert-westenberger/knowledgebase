# Linear Span
The **span** of a collection of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of them. 

#### Examples
* Span of the vectors (1, 5, 3) and (2, 1, 7) is 

$$s \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 5 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix}
2\\ 1 \\ 7
\end{bmatrix}$$

* The span of vectors (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 1) is 
$$s \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix}
0\\ 1 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}$$
which simplifies to 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
s\\t\\t
\end{bmatrix} $$ 
The span of vectors (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 1) is the set of all vectors in $\Reals^3$ whose second and third entries are the same.

* The span of vector (1, 4)
