# 2.3.3 Example: Representing Sets
A set is a collection of distinct objects. Operations involving sets include 
* is_element_of_set - determines whether a given element is a member of a set.
* adjoin_set - takes an object and a set as args and returns a set that contains elements of the original set and also the adjoined element.
* union_set - computes the set containing each element that appears in either argument.
* intersection_set - computes the set containing each element that appear in both arguments.
