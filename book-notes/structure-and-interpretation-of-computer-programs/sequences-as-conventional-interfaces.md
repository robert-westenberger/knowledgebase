# Sequences as Conventional Interfaces

It is frequently helpful to conceptualize processes in terms of signals flowing through a cascade of stages, each of which implements part of the program plan. 

Compare the algorithms for summing the squares of the leaves of a  [tree](/computer-science/trees) that are odd and constructing a list of even fibo numbers *Fib(k)* where *k* is less than or equal to *n*.
