# Assignment and Local State

Programming without the use of assignments is known as functional programming and is deterministic ( there are no side effects. Given inputs will always produce the same outputs ). 

Assignment can improve the modularity of systems. It allows us to model objects that have local state. 
Introducing assignment however breaks the substitution model of function application.
