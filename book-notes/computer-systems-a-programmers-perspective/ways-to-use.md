# Using Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
![csapp_courses.png](/csapp_courses.png)

### 5 Basic styles of systems courses that can be taught from the book
#### Org 
A computer organization course with traditional topics covered in an untraditional style. Traditional topics such as logic design, processor architecture, assembly language, and memory systems are covered. However, there is more emphasis on the impact for the programmer. For example, data representations are related back to the data types and operations of C programs, and the presentation on assembly code is based on machine code generated by a C compiler rather than handwritten assembly code.
#### Org+ 
additional emphasis on the impact of hardware
on the performance of application programs. Compared to ORG, students
learn more about code optimization and about improving the memory performance of their C programs.
#### ICS
The baseline ICS course, designed to produce enlightened programmers who
understand the impact of the hardware, operating system, and compilation
system on the performance and correctness of their application programs.
A significant difference from ORG+ is that low-level processor architecture
is not covered. Instead, programmers work with a higher-level model of a
modern out-of-order processor. The ICS course fits nicely into a 10-week
quarter, and can also be stretched to a 15-week semester if covered at a
more leisurely pace.
#### ICS+
The baseline ICS course with additional coverage of systems programming
topics such as system-level I/O, network programming, and concurrent programming. This is the semester-long Carnegie Mellon course, which covers
every chapter in CS:APP except low-level processor architecture.
