# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information
* Bit patterns are written in hexadecimal (base-16) notation. 
* Every computer has a word size, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Most computers now have a 64 bit word size. A 64 bit machine has a massive virtual address space compared to 32 bit machines. 
* The amount of bytes allocated for different data types in C is dependent on how it is compiled (32 bit vs 64 bit).
