# The Derivative of a Function
Calculus is divided into two main parts.

* **Integral** calculus joins the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes.

* **Differential** calculus divides thing into different small pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next.

Above, the graph of a function (black), and a tangent line to that function (red). The slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.
