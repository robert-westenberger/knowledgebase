# The Computation of Derivatives
## 3.1 Derivatives of Polynomials

1) The derivative of a constant is 0.
2) If n is a positive integer, then 
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$$
The derivative of $x^n$ is obtained by bringing the exponent n down in front as a coefficient, then subtracting $1$ from it to form the new exponent $n-1$
