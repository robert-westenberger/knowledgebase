# The Computation of Derivatives
## 3.1 Derivatives of Polynomials

1) The derivative of a constant is 0.
2) If n is a positive integer, then 
$$\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$$
The derivative of $x^n$ is obtained by bringing the exponent n down in front as a coefficient, then subtracting $1$ from it to form the new exponent $n-1$
3) If $c$ is a constant and $u = f(x)$ is a differentiable function of $x$, then
$$\frac{d}{dx}(cu)=c\frac{du}{dx}$$
The derivative of a constant times a function equals the constant times the derivative of the function.
4) If $u=f(x)$ and $v=g(x)$ are function of x, then
$$\frac{d}{dx}(u+v)=\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dx}$$
Combining rules two and three, we see that 
$$\frac{d}{dx}cx^n=cnx^{n-1}$$

4) If $u = f(x)$ and $v=g(x)$ are functions of x, then
$$\frac{d}{dx}(u+v)=\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dx}$$

The derivative of the sum of two functions equals the sum of the individual derivatives. In essentially the same way, the derivative of a difference equals the difference of the derivatives.
