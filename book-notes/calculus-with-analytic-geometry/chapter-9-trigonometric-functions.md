# Trigonometric Functions
## 9.5 The Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Recall that inverse functions are functions that "reverse" another function. For example

$$f(x) = 3x - 4$$
$$f^{-1}(y) = \frac{4+ y}{3}$$

Our function $f(x)$ multiplies $x$ by 3 and subtracts 4 from the result. The inverse of that operation would be adding 4 to y and diving the result by 3.
