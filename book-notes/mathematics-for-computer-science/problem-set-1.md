# Problem Set 1

## Problem 1
A real number r is called sensible if there exist positive integers a and b such
that $\sqrt{a/b} = r$. For example, setting $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ shows that $\sqrt 2$ is sensible. Prove that $\sqrt[3]2$ is not sensible. (Consider only positive real roots in this problem).
