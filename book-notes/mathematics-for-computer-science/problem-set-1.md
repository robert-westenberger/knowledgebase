# Problem Set 1 (MIT OCW 6.042J Fall '05): Mathematics for Computer Science

## Problem 1
A real number r is called sensible if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$ such
that $\sqrt{a/b} = r$. For example, setting $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ shows that $\sqrt 2$ is sensible. Prove that $\sqrt[3]2$ is not sensible. (Consider only positive real roots in this problem).

### Solution
We use proof by contradiction. Suppose that $\sqrt[3]2 = \frac ab$ where a and b are two positive integers.
