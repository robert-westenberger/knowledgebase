# What is a Proof? 
A **mathematical proof** of a **proposition** is a chain of **logical deductions** leading to the proposition from a base set of **axioms**. 

A **proposition** is a statement that is either true or false. 

**Claim:** For every nonnegative integer n the value of $n^2+n+41$ is prime.

We can check $n=0$ to $n=39$ and the claim holds true. However, for $n=40$ we get $40^2 + 40 + 41 = 41* 41$ which is not prime. This example highlights, in general, you can't check a claim about an infinite set by checking a finite sample of its elements, no matter how large the sample.
