# Sentential Logic
## Deductive Reasoning and Logical Connectives
We can use letters to stand in for unambiguous statements that are either true or false. 

It will also be useful to have **connective symbols** to stand in for some of the words used to combine statements. 

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\text { Symbol } & \text { Meaning } \\
\hline \vee & \text { or } \\
\wedge & \text { and } \\
\neg & \text { not }
\end{array}
$$
