# Problem
Given two binary search trees `root1` and `root2`, return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range $[0, 5000]$.
- $-10^5 \le \text{Node.val} \le 10^5$

## Examples
**Input**: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
<pre>
2      1
/\     /\
1 4   0  3
</pre>
**Output**: 
[0,1,1,2,3,4]
