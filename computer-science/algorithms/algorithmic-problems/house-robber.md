# Problem
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

## Examples
**Example** 1:

**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output**: 4
**Explanation**: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


**Example** 2:

**Input**: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
**Output**: 12
**Explanation**: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 
# Approach

This particular problem and most of others can be approached using the following sequence:

1. Find recursive relation
2. Recursive (top-down)
3. Recursive + memo (top-down)
4. Iterative + memo (bottom-up)
5. Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

## Step 1 (Find relation)
Figure out recursive relation.
A robber has 2 options: a) rob current house i; b) don't rob current house.
If an option "a" is selected it means she can't rob previous i-1 house but can safely proceed to the one before previous i-2 and gets all cumulative loot that follows.
If an option "b" is selected the robber gets all the possible loot from robbery of i-1 and all the following buildings.
So it boils down to calculating what is more profitable:

robbery of current house + loot from houses before the previous
loot from the previous house robbery and any loot captured before that

`rob(i) = Math.max( rob(i - 2) + currentHouseValue, rob(i - 1) `

## Step 2 (Code recursive relation)
```public int rob(int[] nums) {
    return rob(nums, nums.length - 1);
}
private int rob(int[] nums, int i) {
    if (i < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return Math.max(rob(nums, i - 2) + nums[i], rob(nums, i - 1));
}
```

## Step 3 (Recursive relation + memoization)
```
int[] memo;
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    memo = new int[nums.length + 1];
    Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
    return rob(nums, nums.length - 1);
}

private int rob(int[] nums, int i) {
    if (i < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (memo[i] >= 0) {
        return memo[i];
    }
    int result = Math.max(rob(nums, i - 2) + nums[i], rob(nums, i - 1));
    memo[i] = result;
    return result;
}
```

## Step 4 (Iterative + Memo) (Bottom up)
```
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] memo = new int[nums.length + 1];
    memo[0] = 0;
    memo[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int val = nums[i];
        memo[i+1] = Math.max(memo[i], memo[i-1] + val);
    }
    return memo[nums.length];
}
```
## Step 5 (Iterative + 2 vars) ( Bottom up )
We can notice that in the previous step we use only memo[i] and memo[i-1], so going just 2 steps back. We can hold them in 2 variables instead. This optimization is met in Fibonacci sequence creation and some other problems 

```
/* the order is: prev2, prev1, num  */
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int prev1 = 0;
    int prev2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int tmp = prev1;
        prev1 = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
        prev2 = tmp;
    }
    return prev1;
}
```
