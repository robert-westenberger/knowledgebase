# Problem
Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.

A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4^].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105
