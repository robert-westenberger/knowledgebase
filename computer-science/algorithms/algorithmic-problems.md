# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.
## Examples
[Coin Change Problem](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/coin-change-problem) - Calculate how many ways you can make change for an amount of money, given a set of coins. This is a variation of the knapsack problem.


[Max Path Sum in a Pyramid of Numbers](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/max-path-sum-in-a-pyramid-of-numbers) - Calculate the maximum sum, from the top to the bottom of a pyramid, when you're only allowed to move to adjacent numbers at each level.

[Minimum Cost Path](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/minimum-cost-path) - Given a 2D matrix where each cell has a cost to travel, find a path from the left-top corner to the bottom-right corner with minimum travel cost. You can only move right or down. 
# Pointer Algorithms 
Algorithms that take advantage of the structure of data, using pointers, to calculate something. 
## Examples
[Detect Loop in Linked List (Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list) - Uses two pointers, moving through a linked list at different speeds, to detect a loop.
# Backtracking
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constrant satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
## Examples
[Generate Valid Parentheses](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/generate-valid-parentheses) - For a number `n`, generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

# Sliding Window Technique
A computational technique which aims to reduce the use of a nested loop and replace it with a single loop (thereby reducing time complexity).

## When to use it
For finding subarrays in an array that satisfies given conditions. 


## Examples
### Find the longest substring of a string containing distinct characters
[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)
### Find the longest substring of a string containing `k` distinct characters.
Given a string and a positive number `k`, find the longest substring of the string containing `k` distinct characters. If `k` is more than the total number of distinct characters in the string, return the whole string.
### Find all substrings of a string that are a permutation of another string.
Find all substrings of a string that contains all characters of another string. In other words, find all substrings of the first string that are anagrams of the second string.
### Find maximum length sequence of continuous ones (Using Sliding Window)
Given a binary array, find the index of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get a maximum length sequence of continuous ones.
### Count distinct absolute values in a sorted array
Given an array of sorted integers that may contain several duplicate elements, count the total number of distinct absolute values in it.

# Trees
## Balancing
### Examples
#### Balance a Binary Search Tree
## Insertions
### Examples
#### Build a "Maximum Binary Tree"
[Maximum Binary Tree](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/maximum-binary-tree)
## Traversals
### Examples
#### Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree
[Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/find-corresponding-node-of-a-binary-tree-in-a-clone-of-that-tree)
#### Sum of Nodes With Even Valued Grandparent
[Sum of Nodes With Even Valued Grandparent](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent)
#### Sum Numbers In A Range In A Binary Search Tree
[Range Sum of Binary Search Tree](/computer-science/algorithms/algorithmic-problems/range-sum-of-bst)
