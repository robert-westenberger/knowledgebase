# Bit Level Operations


#### Bitwise Operators

* NOT - Unary operation. Bits that are 0 become 1, those that are 1 become 0.
* AND - Binary operation, taking two equal-length binary representations and performs logical AND. If both bits compared are 1, then return 1. Otherwise return 0. 
* Or - Binary operation, taking two equal-length bit patterns and performs inclusive OR. Returns 0 iff both bits are 0, else return 1.
