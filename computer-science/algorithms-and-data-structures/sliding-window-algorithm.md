Primarily used for the problems dealing with linear data structures like Arrays, Lists, Strings, etc. 

The main idea behind the sliding window technique is to convert two nested loops into a single loop.

A **window** is formed over some part of the data, and the window can slide over the data to capture different portions of it.

## Determining whether the Sliding Window technique is applicable
* Problem involves an ordered, iterable data structure like an array, list, string etc.
* The ask is to find part of the given data structure (longest/shortest subarray, substring etc)

## Common Problems for which Sliding Window techique is applicable
1. Calculate maximum sum of k consecutive elements in an array
2. Anagram substring search
