Will focus on three fundamental abstract data types

1) Containers
2) Dictionaries
3) Priority Queues

and see how they can be implemented with arrays and lists.

# Contiguous Data Structures
Composed of single slabs of memory, and include arrays, matrices, heaps, and hash tables

## Array
Structures of fixed-size data records such that each element can be efficiently located by its index.

### Advantages (of contiguously-allocated arrays)

# Linked Data Structures
Composed of distinct chunks of memory bound together by pointers, and include lists, trees, and graph adjacency lists.
