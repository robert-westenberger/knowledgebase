A hash map is an associative array / dictionary composed of a collection of key value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. 

A hash table uses a **hash function** to compute an index (also code a **hash code**), into an array of **buckets** or **slots**, from which the desired value can be found. 

Internally, hash tables use an array as storage and uses a hash function to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or located from.
