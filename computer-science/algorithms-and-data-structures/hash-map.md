A hash map is an associative array / dictionary composed of a collection of key value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. 

A hash table uses a **hash function** to compute an index (also code a **hash code**), into an array of **buckets** or **slots**, from which the desired value can be found. 

Internally, hash tables use an array as storage and uses hashing to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or located from.
