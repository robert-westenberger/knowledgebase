# Properties of Algorithms
▶ **Input**. An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
▶ **Output**. From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified
set. The output values are the solution to the problem.
▶ **Definiteness**. The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.
▶ **Correctness**. An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input
values.
▶ **Finiteness**. An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps
large) number of steps for any input in the set.
▶ **Effectiveness**. It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a
finite amount of time.
▶ **Generality**. The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not
just for a particular set of input values.
