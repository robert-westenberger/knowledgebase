# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.
## Examples

[Coin Change Problem](/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/algorithmic-problems/coin-change-problem) - Calculate how many ways you can make change for an amount of money, given a set of coins. This is a variation of the knapsack problem.


[Max Path Sum in a Pyramid of Numbers](/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/algorithmic-problems/max-path-sum-in-a-pyramid-of-numbers) - Calculate the maximum sum, from the top to the bottom of a pyramid, when you're only allowed to move to adjacent numbers at each level.

[Minimum Cost Path](/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/algorithmic-problems/minimum-cost-path) - Given a 2D matrix where each cell has a cost to travel, find a path from the left-top corner to the bottom-right corner with minimum travel cost. You can only move right or down. 
# Pointer Algorithms 
Algorithms that take advantage of the structure of data, using pointers, to calculate something. 
## Examples
[Detect Loop in Linked List (Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm](/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/algorithmic-problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list) - Uses two pointers, moving through a linked list at different speeds, to detect a loop.
