Divide and conquer is an algorithmic design paradigm that breaks down a problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size, solves the subproblems recursively, and then combines those solutions to tcreate a solution to the original problem. 

At each level of the recursion there are three steps: 
* **Divide** - The problem is broken into smaller subproblems
* **Conquer** - The subproblems are solved recursively.
* **Combine** - The solutions to the subproblems are combined into the solution for the original problem.
