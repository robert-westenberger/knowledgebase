# Problem
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is $23$.

<pre>
   <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">3</span>
  <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">7</span> 4
 2 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">4</span> 6
8 5 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">9</span> 3
</pre>

That is, $3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23$.
