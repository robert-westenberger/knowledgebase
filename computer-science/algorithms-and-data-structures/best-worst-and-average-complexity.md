* **Best-case** - Minimum number of steps taken in any instance of size $n$.
* **Average-case** - Average number of steps over all instances of size $n$. Average-case is useful for randomized algorithms.
* **Worst-case** - Maximum number of steps taken in any instance of size $n$. This is typically the most important / useful case to observe.
