# Integer Representations

#### Integral Data Types
* C integral data types ( char, short, int, long, signed and unsigned) have different minimum and maximum allocatable bytes (dependent on whether its compiled on 32 or 64 bit machines). 

#### Unsigned Encodings
* Unsigned encodings
	* An integer can be encoded as a bit vector. 
  $$B2U_{w}\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$$
