# Hashing
See [Hash Map](/computer-science/algorithms-and-data-structures/hash-map) more info. 

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. 

Hashing can be considered as one-way encryption. Once something is hashed, it can never be reversed back to its original form.
## Uses
- Access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval.
- Require an amount of storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves.
- Avoids the non-linear access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys.
- Ensure integrity of information being sent over a network. If even one thing is changed, the hashing output is changed.
