# Trees

* A way to think of a sequence of sequences is a tree. The elements of the sequence are branches of the tree, and elements that are themselves sequences are subtrees.
* [Recursion](/computer-science/recursion) is a natural tool for dealing with tree structures, since we can reduce operations on trees to operations on their branches, which reduce to operations on branches of branches, etc.
